This is my attempt at creating the [Enigma Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) used by the Germans in WW2 to encrypt messages.

Rotor configurations can be found [here](https://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/rotorspec.htm).

A nice simulator can be found [here](https://mckoss.com/enigma-simulator-js/).
